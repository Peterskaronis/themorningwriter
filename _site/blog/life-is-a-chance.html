        <p>Life is a test. An everyday non-stop, relentless test of faith, willpower, endurance and mental strain. This is inevitable and it is part of the package. We all get the same. Like a never ending groundhog day. We wake up either prepared, or not having learnt our lessons, we wake up unprepared to face the same, mistakes and walk into the same pitfalls.</p>

<p>There must be a point in the a point in the day for reflection and evaluation. What did I learn today? What can I use for a guide tomorrow? This is something most of us don’t do and we’re bound to repeat the same mistakes.</p>

<p>When it happens a few days in a row; that is we fail to learn from aour mistakes, we end up rolling into days of anger, bitterness and disappointment. There is no escaping this moment of despair or so we think and feel. There is another version of ourselves in a parallel universe that is hsppy, fulfilled and jumps out of bed each morning to seze the day. What are they doing differently?</p>

<p>Perhaps they say NO more often, as much as to other people, as they do to themselves. Self-discipline is a catalystic component in making strides towards your imagined life. It is the glue that cteates tangible, measurable progress that propels you even closer to what is possible. Being able to say no to yourself, when procrastination creeps in, and it does when our self-descipline is watered down by what we see as obstacles, is the golden point we must recognise.</p>

  <p>Procrsatination is a survival mechanism.</p>
