        <p>The simple premise of staying true to your words is something of a lost art. In the last few centuries, traits like honour and truth have been watered down as more and more of our lives become digital. We spend an awful amount of time existing in a made up universe where nothing is tangible anymore.</p>

<p>The lack of human touch and connection erodes moral traits that have been passed down by previous generations. Without honour we would still be cavemen. Although this could be debated as well. There was something honourable in striving to survive. We are not striving to survive in the same way anymore; are we?</p>

<p>Although we are not being chased by wild animals, there is an invisible digital world that plays out in our head that manifests itself in the real world. There are some many projects going on at once and this creates an inner turmoil. Nothing is visible externally to others. It looks like, as if we could be occupied by nothing. Just staring at a computer screen, agonising to get something done, something not able to account for.</p>

<p>The mere fact that we set out to accomplish something; anything and we don’t get there, starts to dilute our own being. We can’t keep our word to ourselves anymore. That’s when shame sets in and we start to perceive ourselves as dishonourable people. It doesn’t take much to go down this path. It could be just not having sent that email you promised to someone. The disappointment that overcomes us, it two-fold. We fail to be true to our word for us and then to somebody else.</p>

<p>These feelings of unworthiness in the grand scheme of things is minute, but it is enough to take us down a dark path.</p>

<p>That’s when taking hold of your brain and affirming to yourself the truth is the turning point. There is no point lying to yourself. That is the last thing you want to do. Accept things as they are and set a new starting point. The past is the past. You can’t change what you did a minute ago, but you can learn and don’t repeat it the next.</p>

<p>The psychological fallacies that succumb us, are partly to blame but lack of education is the real culprit here. Learning how to interpret what is happening to you, is key for prioritising your life and do what you said you were going to do.</p>

<p>There is nothing worst than a lifetime having gone by and realising at the end of your days that you allowed circumstances and things outside of your control to be your excuse for not being true to yourself and honouring your words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Small steps today, make giant leaps in a year from now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Start today to honour yourself, by reflecting, prioritising and valuing your words and your actions. Don’t follow the path of least resistance with everyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think before you speak and don’t speak before you have a sense of the weight of your words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you.</p>
