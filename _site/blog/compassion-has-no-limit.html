        <p>Feelings are amazing. They have no limits. Such is the case with compassion. We stop thinking about our own problems and issues and start giving towards others. This capacity of humans has no limits, even if we have to stretch beyond our physical limits. We are overcome by a sense of duty and responsibility to help another and get them back to their homeostasis. We don’t like suffering and pain and we can’t tolerate it in others. Especially kids.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone has the capacity to be compassionate but not everyone does. It is a limitless well of love and understanding but it somehow stays dormant in most people. The problem lies in the way we are being brought up. It is passed down by our parents and society. Environment plays a big part too. We have adopted the idea that we, humans have the power over all living and non-living things on this planet and therefore we must take advantage of it to our best interest.</p>

<p>We have been taking advantage of our planet for the few last centuries but with greed as our guide and not compassion. Greed has poisoned our souls and blinded us. We have lost compassion for our environment, that so abundantly provides the most precious goods, which without it, we would be dead in a minute. That is oxygen.</p>

<p>Yet, we have no compassion when it comes to deforesting the earth to make paper. Just because the wood lobby would not benefit by using hemp as the primary source of paper 200 years ago. One acre of hemp produces the same amount of paper as 5 acres of trees.</p>

<p>I have concluded that compassion is a notion that should be part of our education. Learning to appreciate the earth that provides for us nutrients for our body and other material for clothing and housing. There is such a disconnect from reality these days that a kid growing up now can recognise over 100 brand logos but not a single plant. Therefore, our newest generations would rightly assume that food comes from McDonalds.</p>

<p>Being compassionate to our environment and others is something to aspire to become but it doesn’t happen overnight. The more you can disconnect from the material world that is made up around us and start connecting with the physical world, the sooner you can start appreciating that nature’s compassion has no limits towards our destructive behaviour.</p>

<p>Another concept that we don’t learn in schools is kindness.</p>

<p>When was the last time you killed a spider?</p>

<p>It seems so tiny and so insignificant but it has a place here. That primarily stems from lack of love and kindness to ourselves. We are harsh and unjust to us. We criticise and judge ourself about our actions and mistakes and we almost never acknowledge our successes. We expect others to do that for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is person left with when he is abusive to himself and seeks approval and praise from others?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alone.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to be kind to others if you always criticise yourself. However, there are cases that people believe that they deserve to be miserable and being kind to others is more appropriate, as the ones who diverse it more.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t accept someone being rude to you but you do this to yourself every minute of the day. Take the time to weed out these beliefs that hold you back and stop justifying these behaviours to yourself.</p>

<p>Kindness to ourselves can have astonishing results for the whole world. We affect our environment, with the thoughts we have and the energy we emit.</p>
