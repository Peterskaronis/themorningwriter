We have associated living and existing with the possession and accumulation of material objects and money. The more the better. We are not the ones to blame. We are brought up this way. As Wayne Dyer used to say, when we are in the morning phase of our life we are consumed by these beliefs. There is a point though that we reach and we start to catch glimpses of something else.

There is a point where we start asking ourselves if this is all there is? We don’t need to struggle but rather let go. Let go of worrying. Let go of stress. Let go of ego.

The ego drives us. We were born whole and complete and ego makes us believe that we are not and we will never be. The moment we let go, the moment we are free from ego, that moment we can start living a life of purpose. The purpose of ours is a calling that we have buried deep inside. We make so much noise that it cannot be heard.

> We don’t want to die with our music still inside us.

The music is there, we just have to play it. Be quiet and listen for it. Everyone’s journey is going to be different. Adopting a minimalistic lifestyle is one of the ways, if we are to be free. Live light is an interesting proposition. What does that look like? Less possessions? I have always had an aversion to over decorated houses and traveling with half the house in my luggages. The feeling of freedom is both literal and metaphorical. I once read a blog from the minimalists on how to become a minimalist. The concept is quite simple. Pack all of your belongings in brown boxes as if you were moving houses. Every day take out of the boxes the items you only need to use. In 30 days you will have used exactly the things you need.

The rest you can throw away, donate and sell. How many people do you know who are ready to detach themselves from possessions for the sake of their freedom? Very few.

As Wayne Dyer says in the documentary “The Shift”, everything is provided by a higher power the first 9 months of our lives. Why not trust that this higher source has everything else taken care of for the rest of our lives?

The ego is trying to make us believe that we are separate from this higher source and that we don’t need this connection. We need to let go of the ego and let our light spread. We are the light as we are one with god and god is everything.

Letting go of the ego, is not a trivial task but it takes daily practise. This isn’t about effort and struggle but rather not doing anything. To not be guided by our ego. How would your life be different if you knew all you needed was within you right now?
