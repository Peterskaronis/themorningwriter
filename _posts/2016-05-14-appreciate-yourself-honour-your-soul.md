How can we appreciate ourself and honour our soul when we are bound within the confines of the ego?

When we are not aware of our ego, we are destined to ask this question operating from a place ego. Thus, our answer will always be in a way that serves the ego, but not ourself or our soul.

When we becomes aware of the existence of ego and its overreaching reigns, that’s when we realise that our life so far, has not been one of choice, but one of obedience and service to the ego. We can only begin to understand the power of ego over us, by examining our thoughts. Every action begins as a thought.

This life of ours is a gift. It is a miracle how we come into existence. Everything is taken care for us by a higher power, god, source whatever you believe it to be. As we originate from this higher power, so we are a part of it.

The society, well meaning parents and our environment, teach us from a young age, that we are separate from everything else. We get conditioned to listen to the voice of the ego. As Dr. Wayne Dyer explained in the movie “The Shift”, ego has an agenda.

Ego tells us that we are what we have. The more material goods we accumulate, the more we are. The trouble with this notion, is that when we loose these material possessions, we lose who we are in the process.

The next step that ego teaches us, is that we are what we do. We are our jobs and the respect and recognition that comes with it. This is so dangerous as most people identify their self with what they do and if this is taken away, they die.

The opinion of others about us, is another working of the ego. We are what others think we are and not what our own nature tell us.

The notion of being separate from everyone around us and thus disconnected is another false idea that has been embedded in our thinking patterns.

The final item on the ego’s agenda is separation from god. We are led to believe that we are this body that we have and we are the ones that can control everything, even things outside of our control. The belief that we are separate from god and don’t need anything is to deny our own nature. Deny ourself.

When you deny yourself how can you appreciate yourself? How much room for thinking and feeling your soul is there?

Our life is a gift. Our body is a vehicle. Our soul embraces the universe.

Listening to stories from people who had near death experiences there is a repeating theme. Most people will describe that they could see their body from above and could feel as being one with everything. They could feel what everyone was feeling and it was ever expanding.

Thinking ourself as a part of god, makes us appreciate who we are without external prerequisites and conditions. To honour our soul is to embrace the notion of its limitlessness and start thinking outside the boundaries of our physical body.

As Dr. Wayne Dyer’s teacher responded when asked what was real, he said:

 > Real is that which never changes

 We have been in many bodies since childhood and we are going to be in many more as we grow. What is real is your soul. Honour it.
