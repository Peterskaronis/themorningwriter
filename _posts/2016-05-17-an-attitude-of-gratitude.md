Stress, anxiety and fear of what the day might bring is not a healthy way to lead your life. Your attitude towards life during our waking moments, from that very first moment of opening your eyes in the morning, can have significant life-changing impact. Let the very first thoughts and words that ensue and emanate from your heart and mind to be “Thank you”. You are being grateful for being given another day, with which to make something of it that wouldn’t have been without you.

The notion of taking things for granted is an epidemic that affects everyone on this planet and extends from the material to the spiritual realm. We have grown up with a false sense of entitlement to things that will not leave us any better off having acquired them. The sentence I’ve heard so many times and probably said myself at some points in my life, “I just want to know what I am entitled to, nothing more, nothing less”.

Well, life has a way of teaching us that we are entitled to this life, to oxygen and water and all the wonderful creations that nature provides. When we separate ourself from the rest of the world and we just focus solely on endless quests just to satisfy the ego, we detach ourself from even the most fundamental elements of life, oxygen. We become stiff, we don’t allow breath to escape and we are getting in our own way.

It is such a difficult place to be in and operate from, without any hope of escaping. When we interfere with our breathing, oxygen doesn’t get into the body, our thinking gets cloudy, our energy levels drop and we become OCD with just a single though that can’t be solved or cannot be and never will. At that point we lack perspective, objective judgement and are doomed to enter a downward spiral. 

However unpleasant such states may be, they have a purpose and a usefulness. They are a teacher of sorts. We just have to show up and pay attention. We have been brought up in this world of dualism, where we can tell good by getting to know evil. We realise that we are human beings and not human doings. We thing, finding solutions to our problems that by the way only exist in our head, is the answer. There isn’t only one way to anything. It might be that we need to ask slightly different questions instead of fixating on this answer finding marathon. We may find that there is wisdom and a way in the small things that we take for granted.

Start from this moment on, realising that we have a miraculous body that was provided for us to experience this life and runs perfectly when not interrupted. Being grateful is not just semantics, it is reality. Change your attitude to life, even before you rise. Say Thank you. Life will respond back. Some words to repeat in the morning.

Thanks You.

I am well.
I am healthy.
I am vibrant.

When operation from a state of gratitude, we allow our mind to generate frequencies that look for and attract new opportunities that were previously covered with a dark veil.

Doors are opening all the time, but we can’t see them, because we are so fixated on the one door that closed.

Our mind starts seeing connections and coincidence and synchronicity appear in our life. We start anticipating these events and look forward to what each day will bring.
